There is guy whose name is Mark. Mark is a CS student. Student majoring in computer science must take CS400. 400 is a hard class Mark said to himself everyday. Everyday Mark has to working CS400, either HW or programs. Program this week is about RBT. RBT is BRUTAL.

One day, Mark decided enough was enough. After class, Mark asked his professor
for assistance. She was very king and helpful, and suggested that if he ever
needs additional help he can ask the TAs as they are more likely to have spare
time to help. From then on, whenever Mark got even a little confused, he would
ask the TAs and they would manage to help him every time.
