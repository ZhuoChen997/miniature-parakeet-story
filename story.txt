There is guy whose name is Mark. Mark is a CS student. Student majoring in computer science must take CS400. 400 is a hard class Mark said to himself everyday. Everyday Mark has to working CS400, either HW or programs. Program this week is about RBT. RBT is BRUTAL.

One day, Mark decided enough was enough. After class, Mark asked his professor
for assistance. She was very king and helpful, and suggested that if he ever
needs additional help he can ask the TAs as they are more likely to have spare
time to help. From then on, whenever Mark got even a little confused, he would
ask the TAs and they would manage to help him every time.

Although cs400 started out as very hard for Mark, the TA and professor help
changed Mark's mindset about the class.  By the time the midterm exam came
around, Mark had asked the TA's so many questions he knew all of their names.
He made sure to prepare very hard for the midterm because he knew it was worth
a large percentage of his grade.  He reviewed his programs, his lecture
notes, his readings, and his quizzes to help him prepare.  The only problem
was, he stayed up until 4AM doing so.
